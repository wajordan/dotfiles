## .dotfiles
`.gitignore` is set up to ignore everything first and then deliberately include certain files and directories into the domain of git management.

#### Zsh file structure
```
~/
│   .zshenv
│   .aliases
│   .zshrc
│   .gitconfig
│   .git-completion.bash
│
└───.zsh
│   │   git-completion.zsh
│   │
```

> *I primarily use zsh and vim and specifially vim with the pathogen plugin for managing all my plugins. However, I also include here a bash configuration that mostly duplicates the functionality of the zsh configuration, but I don't maintain it as frequently as it is mostly for those situations where I find myself with access to bash and not zsh.*

In the zsh scripts, the hostname and account completion are split into private local files. In addition, the scripts support a `.localenv` file for environment settings that may be specific to a particular machine and so shouldn't be maintained in a repo for common usage.
